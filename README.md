# Steganography

Project: Image-based steganography

This project entails the development of a steganographic software module designed to embed secret messages within digital images through the subtle alteration of the least significant bits (LSB) of the RGB color channels of image pixels. By leveraging this LSB steganography technique, the system ensures the covert transmission of information with negligible impact on the image's visual fidelity. The software features advanced algorithms for both the encoding and decoding processes, enabling users to securely embed and extract textual data within images without inducing perceptible visual distortions, thereby maintaining the integrity of the original digital media.
